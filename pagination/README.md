This project focuses on implementing pagination techniques in Python. It includes helper functions and classes for managing large datasets through pagination.

## Learning Objectives
- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

## Requirements
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.9)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)
- All modules, functions, and methods are documented
- All functions and coroutines are type-annotated
